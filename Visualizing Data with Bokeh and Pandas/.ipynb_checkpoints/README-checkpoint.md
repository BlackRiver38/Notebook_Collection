# Visualizing Data with Bokeh and Pandas

I'm going recreate the tutorial presented by the username Charlie Harper which you cna find here:

https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh

My main goal is to reach the same result as him with updated version of the bokeh package and provide a more step-to-step Jupyter Notebook. 

Hope you enjoy it.
